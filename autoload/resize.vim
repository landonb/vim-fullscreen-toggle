" display-aware gVim/MacVim window fullsizer and resizer

" +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ "

" AUDIENCE: Mostly MacVim users, but also useful for gVim with `xrandr`.

" USAGE: Press F11 to resize gVim/MacVim, and cycle through sizes.
"
" - BONUS: Shift-F11 toggle puts Vim in right-half of screen.
"
" - To use your own bindings, define g:TBVIMCreateDefaultMappings = 0
"   to skip the <F11> and <S-F11> mappings, and then define your own.

" WHY THIS PLUGIN:
"
"   - In GNOME and MATE, the *Maximize* and *Unmaximize* features are similar.
"
"     (So you might not (I really don't) find a need for this plugin on Linux.)
"
"     The Maximize features are reachable many different ways:
"
"     - Double-click the titlebar.
"
"     - Right-click the titlebar and choose Maximize or Unmaximize.
"
"     - Press <Alt-Space> and then <x>.
"
"     In fact, Maximize works better, as it'll expand the window completely
"     to the edges of the available desktop space, whereas this plugin
"     expands to nearest the column or row. I.e., you'll likely see a
"     tidge of space between Vim and screen-edge after pressing F11.
"
"   - On macOS, however, there is no obvious equivalent to GNOME/MATE Maximize.
"
"     - You can double-click the titlebar to 'Zoom' the window, but that only
"       maximizes the height, and it leaves the window width unchanged. (That
"       feature is also found at Window > Zoom, and Shift-Cmd-Z.)
"
"     - You can click the green circle in the titlebar, or choose the Window >
"       Toggle Full Screen Mode option (Shift-Cmd-F), which *will* make the
"       window fullscreen, but it also puts the window all alone on a new
"       Mission Control 'space', which not only might break your Alt-Tab usage
"       (I've got mine setup to only switch between windows on the same space),
"       but it's also annoyingly slow (I almost never use Full Screen Mode on
"       macOS because it takes so long to animate the changing of the spaces,
"       and it's also visually disruptive, super annoying to me).
"
"     - However, there is a great windowing application called Rectangle
"       that I highly recommend.
"
"         https://rectangleapp.com/
"
"       Specifically, the Rectangle *Maximize* command works similar to
"       this plugin. (See also *Restore* to undo the maximize.)
"
"   - This plugin is untested on Windows.

" NOTES: The Shift-F11 is similar to some desktop manager mappings:
"
"   - On macOS, consider also the Rectangle.app *Right Half* command.
"
"   - On MATE, see 'Tile window to east (right) side of screen' binding.
"
"   - But those mechanism will not resize the Vim window panes, whereas
"     this plugin with adjust vertical splits to equal widths.

" WORDS: Perhaps to differentiate from macOS 'Full Screen Mode'
"        this plugin should rather be called 'fillscreen'.
