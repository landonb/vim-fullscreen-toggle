1. About This Plugin			*vim-fs-toggle*

Display-aware Vim fullscreen toggle.

This plugin is a dual-display-aware version of an old trick:

 `set columns=999 lines=999`

which will resize a gVim/MacVim window to fill the screen.

But that trick breaks when there's more than one monitor attached.

This plugin restricts the resize to just one monitor, and
it also adjusts vertical splits to be equal widths.

2. Fullscreen Toggle Commands		*vim-fs-toggle-cmds*

Resize gVim/MacVim window~

				*<F11>*
<F11>			Change gVim/MacVim window dimensions.
			Cycles through 3 different window sizes:
			fullscreen → mostly fullscreen → original size → (repeat).
			If the original size when user first presses `<F11>`
			is already fullscreen or mostly fullscreen, the plugin
			will only cycle through 2 sizes: fullscreen → mostly

			
				*<Shift-F11>*
<Shift-F11>>		Restrict to right-half of display.
			Like `<F11>`, cycles through 3 different window sizes,
			but sets window width and position to right-half of display.

Override~

To use your own mappings, define `g:TBVIMCreateDefaultMappings = 0` to
inhibit the `<F11>` and `<S-F11>` mappings, and then define your own.
