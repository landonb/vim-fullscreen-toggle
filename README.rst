About This Plugin
=================

Display-aware Vim fullscreen toggle.

Fullscreen Window Commands
==========================

This plugin is a dual-display-aware version of an old trick::

  set columns=999 lines=999

which will resize a gVim/MacVim window to fill the screen.

But that trick breaks when there's more than one monitor attached.

This plugin restricts the resize to just one monitor.

After resizing, It also adjusts vertical splits to be equal widths.

                                                            will only cycle through 2 sizes: fullscreen → mostly fullscreen → (repeat).

Override
========

By default, this plugin will define both ``<F11>`` and ``<S-F11>`` maps,
and it'll run on startup (to set window dimensions to mostly fullscreen).

If you'd like to define your own maps and to call resize on your own time,
you can inhibit the default behavior by setting a global variable::

  let g:vim_fullscreen_toggle_disable = 1

Installation
============

Installation is easy using the packages feature (see ``:help packages``).

To install the package so that it will automatically load on Vim startup,
use a ``start`` directory, e.g.,

.. code-block::

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/embrace-vim/start
    cd ~/.vim/pack/embrace-vim/start

If you want to test the package first, make it optional instead
(see ``:help pack-add``):

.. code-block::

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/embrace-vim/opt
    cd ~/.vim/pack/embrace-vim/opt

Clone the project to the desired path:

.. code-block::

    git clone https://github.com/embrace-vim/vim-fullscreen-toggle.git

If you installed to the optional path, tell Vim to load the package:

.. code-block:: vim

    :packadd! vim-fullscreen-toggle

Just once, tell Vim to build the online help:

.. code-block:: vim

    :Helptags

Then whenever you want to reference the help from Vim, run:

.. code-block:: vim

    :help vim-fullscreen-toggle

.. |vim-plug| replace:: ``vim-plug``
.. _vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

.. |Vundle| replace:: ``Vundle``
.. _Vundle: https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim

.. |myrepos| replace:: ``myrepos``
.. _myrepos: https://myrepos.branchable.com/

.. |ohmyrepos| replace:: ``ohmyrepos``
.. _ohmyrepos: https://github.com/landonb/ohmyrepos

Note that you'll need to update the repo manually (e.g., ``git pull``
occasionally).

- If you'd like to be able to update from within Vim, you could use
  |vim-plug|_.

  - You could then skip the steps above and register
    the plugin like this, e.g.:

.. code-block:: vim

    call plug#begin()

    " List your plugins here
    Plug 'embrace-vim/vim-fullscreen-toggle'

    call plug#end()

- And to update, call:

.. code-block:: vim

    :PlugUpdate

- Similarly, there's also |Vundle|_.

  - You'd configure it something like this:

.. code-block:: vim

    set nocompatible              " be iMproved, required
    filetype off                  " required

    " set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
    set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    call vundle#begin()
    " alternatively, pass a path where Vundle should install plugins
    "call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')

    " let Vundle manage Vundle, required
    Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'

    Plugin 'embrace-vim/vim-fullscreen-toggle'

    " All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
    call vundle#end()            " required
    filetype plugin indent on    " required
    " To ignore plugin indent changes, instead use:
    "filetype plugin on

- And then to update, call one of these:

.. code-block:: vim

    :PluginInstall!
    :PluginUpdate

- Or, if you're like the author, you could use a multi-repo Git tool,
  such as |myrepos|_ (along with the author's library, |ohmyrepos|_).

  - With |myrepos|_, you could update all your Git repos with
    the following command:

.. code-block::

    mr -d / pull

- Alternatively, if you use |ohmyrepos|_, you could pull
  just Vim plugin changes with something like this:

.. code-block::

    MR_INCLUDE=vim-plugins mr -d / pull

- After you identify your vim-plugins using the 'skip' action, e.g.:

.. code-block::

    # Put this in ~/.mrconfig, or something loaded by it.
    [DEFAULT]
    skip = mr_exclusive "vim-plugins"

    [pack/embrace-vim/start/vim-fullscreen-toggle]
    lib = remote_set origin https://github.com/embrace-vim/vim-fullscreen-toggle.git

    [DEFAULT]
    skip = false
